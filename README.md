# jtorrt



## Build and run


With JDK21
```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/jtorrt.jar
```

## Exercise the application

Basic:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
Hello World!
```


JSON:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
{"message":"Hello World!"}

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
{"message":"Hello Joe!"}

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"greeting" : "Hola"}' http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
{"message":"Hola Jose!"}
```



## Exercise Webclient

First, start the server:

```
java -jar target/jtorrt.jar
```

Note the port number that it displays. For example:

```
WEB server is up! http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
```

Then run the client, passing the port number. It will connect
to the server:

```
java -cp "target/classes:target/libs/*" com.github.russp.jtorrt.WebClientMain PORT
```



## Try metrics

```
# Prometheus Format
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/metrics
# TYPE base:gc_g1_young_generation_count gauge
. . .

# JSON Format
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/metrics
{"base":...
. . .
```


## Try health

This example shows the basics of using Helidon SE Health. It uses the
set of built-in health checks that Helidon provides plus defines a
custom health check.

Note the port number reported by the application.

Probe the health endpoints:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/observe/health/ready
```



## Building a Native Image

The generation of native binaries requires an installation of GraalVM 22.1.0+.

You can build a native binary using Maven as follows:

```
mvn -Pnative-image install -DskipTests
```

The generation of the executable binary may take a few minutes to complete depending on
your hardware and operating system. When completed, the executable file will be available
under the `target` directory and be named after the artifact ID you have chosen during the
project generation phase.

Make sure you have GraalVM locally installed:

```
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --version
```

Build the native image using the native image profile:

```
mvn package -Pnative-image
```

This uses the helidon-maven-plugin to perform the native compilation using your installed copy of GraalVM. It might take a while to complete.
Once it completes start the application using the native executable (no JVM!):

```
./target/jtorrt
```

Yep, it starts fast. You can exercise the applicationâ€™s endpoints as before.


## Building the Docker Image

```
docker build -t jtorrt .
```

## Running the Docker Image

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 jtorrt:latest
```

Exercise the application as described above.
